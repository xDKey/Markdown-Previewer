  ## This is a sub-heading...

  Heres some code, \`<div></div>\`, between 2 backticks.

\`\`\`
// this is multi-line code:

function anotherExample(firstLine, lastLine) {
  if (firstLine == '\`\`\`' && lastLine == '\`\`\`') {
    return multiLineCode;
  }
}
\`\`\`

You can also make text **bold**... whoa!

Or _italic_.

Or... wait for it... **_both!_**

And feel free to go crazy ~~crossing stuff out~~.

There's also [links](https://www.google.com), and

Wild Header | Crazy Header | Another Header?
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Your content can | be here, and it | can be here....
And here. | Okay. | I think we get it.

  - Some are bulleted.
     - With different indentation levels.
